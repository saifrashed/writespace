<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# Request strategies
In this project we are using the 'services' directory for all the requests.
Normally, you would have routes, controllers and services, but for this project 
we are keeping it as simple as possible because we only have 4 weeks and a lot of
students do not have any or minimal experience with BE developing.

The test.model.js and test.service.js file are tutorial files so that the code can be copied
and modified for specific user stories so that everyone can easily code in the backend.
